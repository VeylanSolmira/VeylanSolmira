# Hi, I'm Veylan ðŸ‘‹

I'm an independent researcher and engineer transitioning into full-time work in AI safety and alignment. I bring an interdisciplinary background in computational biology, computer science, philosophy, and systems engineeringâ€”with professional experience across data engineering, software development, and site reliability at scale.

## ðŸ”­ Currently working on

- **[Crucible](https://github.com/VeylanSolmira/crucible-eval-platform)**: Open-source infrastructure for secure AI agent evaluation with sandboxed execution
- **[AI Safety Research Compiler](https://github.com/VeylanSolmira/ai-safety-research-compiler)**: Curated pathways and resources for AI alignment research
- **GaiaLogos**: Research testbed for ecologically-bounded agent development with multi-objective RL

## ðŸŒ± Currently learning

- Red/blue team evaluation techniques (Inspect, alignment-faking games)
- Recursive, epistemically-updating reward shaping
- Mechanistic interpretability and deception detection methods

## ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on

- Interpretability tools, deception detection, or oversight systems
- Evaluation frameworks that combine philosophical grounding and engineering fluency
- Alignment projects that treat AI as embedded in an ecological and civilizational context

## ðŸ¤” Open to help with

- Understanding large-scale interpretability workflows (SAEs, tracing tools)
- Publishing or productionizing early-stage alignment tools
- Connecting with mentors or institutions working on practical safety architectures

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about

- Deceptive alignment, narrative compression, AI persuasion risks
- How ecology, ethics, and epistemology can be computationally encoded
- Philosophical perspectives on reward shaping and value alignment
